      Hi! I'm Tianyue, a first-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I have a passion for technology, cooking, cycling, music, and spending time with my furry best friend. In my free time, I love experimenting with new recipes and ingredients and try cuisines from different parts of the world. I also love playing ukulele, which would always give me full relax from studying.
